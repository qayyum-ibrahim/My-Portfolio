You are a senior frontend architect and product engineer.

Your task is to design and implement a production-ready personal portfolio website using Vite + React + TypeScript, showcasing a Backend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer with strong system design and architectural thinking.

This is not a generic portfolio.
The site must clearly communicate technical depth, backend architecture mastery, and founder-level thinking, while also demonstrating modern frontend design sensibility.

Link placeholders for:

Live demo

These projects should NOT be simple apps.
They must be presented as architectural case studies with:

This page should scream:
